/* NOTE-TO-DEVELOPER: 
  You need to add the @tailwind directives to your main CSS file so that Tailwind's styles are properly 
  loaded into your project. 
  
  Tailwind organizes its styles into three layers:
  - Base: Resets and normalizes browser styling (similar to a CSS reset).
  - Components: Tailwindâ€™s pre-designed component styles (e.g., forms, buttons).
  - Utilities: The core utilities that Tailwind is famous for, like margins, padding, text alignment, etc.
